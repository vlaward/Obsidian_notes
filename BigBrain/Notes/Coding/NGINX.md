NGINX is a powerfull tool. It can be use for as a :

-  [[WebServer|Web server]](Static)
- [[ReverseProxy|Reverse Proxy]]
- [[LoadBalancer|Load Balancer]]
- [[HTTPCache|HTTP Cache]]
- [[TLS_SSL_Termination|TLS SSL Termination]]
- [[MailProxy|Mail Proxy]]

It has to be configured with an [[NGINX_utils|nginx.conf]] file.
Nginx is a lightweight, fast operating event-driven system. It's also *non blocking I/O* which means that you can start a new task without waiting for the last one to finish. It's better for static or small contents.
Whereas [[Appache]] is more heavy. It is [[process/thread]] based, got a lot of complexe dynamic modules and configuration.
